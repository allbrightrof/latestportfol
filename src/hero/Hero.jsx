        I'm a passionate Web Developer focused on building clean, responsive, and user-friendly interfaces using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React. I’m currently strengthening my understanding of Data Structures & Algorithms through freeCodeCamp and solving challenges on LeetCode to improve my problem-solving skills.

While my core expertise lies in frontend development, I’m also deeply interested in Cybersecurity, as I aim to combine secure engineering practices with innovative digital solutions.

I’m driven by creativity, continuous learning, and a strong desire to build tech products that positively impact people around the world.
